Nomenclature-go
===============

Nomenclature is a web service written in Go which generates human readable names that
are guaranteed unique. The intended use-case is for naming things like servers, schemas,
etc.

This is a work in progress and is still missing key features for usability.

Usage:

The names generated by Nomenclature are in the ```<Adjective><Noun>``` format, for example
"BadHamster", "PristinePrimate", "DenseEarthworm" and so on.

You will need to prepare two word list text files for nomenclature to use. The first
should contain a newline delimited list of the Adjectives (prefixes) and the second
a newline delimited list of the Nouns (postfixes).

After preparing the two files you can serve them with:

    nomenclature -f1 prefixes.txt -f2 postfixes.txt -p 80

Nomenclature will then start serving names at /names on port 80.
    
Nomenclature will persist it's own state to ensure it doesn't serve duplicate names even
after program exit. By default the state is written out to a file called .state in the
current working directory. You can change this with the "-s <path>" flag.
